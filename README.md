### 5️⃣ Emulator setup — choose the correct executable

Supported emulators: MuMu Player, MEmu, LDPlayer 9.

When the launcher asks you to choose your emulator executable, select the command-line controller for your emulator (not the graphical player app). Below are the executables you should select for each supported emulator, with typical default paths on Windows:

- MuMu Player
  - Executable: MuMuManager.exe
  - Default path: `C:\Program Files\Netease\MuMuPlayerGlobal-12.0\shell\`
                  `C:\Program File\Netease\MuMuPlayer\nx_main\`
- MEmu
  - Executable: memuc.exe
  - Default path: `C:\Program Files\\Microvirt\MEmu\`

- LDPlayer 9
  - Executable: ldconsole.exe
  - Default path: `C:\LDPlayer\LDPlayer9\`

Notes:
- If your emulator is installed in a different location, browse to the folder where that executable resides and select it.
- These executables provide command-line control so the bot can launch/close instances and detect whether they are running.
- LDPlayer only: You must manually enable ADB in the instance settings (Settings → Other settings → ADB debugging = Enable local connection), otherwise the bot cannot connect via ADB.

#### Instance settings

The bot is designed to run on MuMu Player with the following settings:
- Resolution: 720x1280 (320 DPI) (mandatory)
- CPU: 2 Cores
- RAM: 2 GB
- Game Language: English (mandatory)

Note: For best performance and reliability, disable the Snowfall and Day/Night Cycle options in the in-game settings, and avoid using Ultra graphics quality.
